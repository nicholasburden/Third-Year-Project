Hex is a popular two-player board game that is an interesting domain of Artificial Intelligence due to its simplicity and subtle intuitive game-play. In this paper, we explore general AI techniques such as minimax and Monte Carlo tree search, as well as Hex-specific analysis in the form of H-Search and inferior cell analysis. We eventually conclude that the minimax approach is more successful than using Monte Carlo tree search. In addition, we find that hex-specific analysis greatly improves the competence of the agent, although increases the time complexity.
